        data-text=" Théodore Rousseau’s oil on canvas, “Les Chênes d'Apremont,” (1850) exudes a serenity through Rousseau’s portrayal of the scene. The contrast between the color of the trees to the environment presents a sense of warmth for the viewer. The dark colors used for the trees complement its light environment. The inclusion of the cows grazing in the grass adds an aspect of movement to the piece while keeping the moment of stillness the main subject. It is an example of nature being a subject for the visual arts through the beauty and inspiration found in the details of this natural environment. Rousseau’s painting, “Les Chênes d’Apremont,” illustrates this topic of nature as an artist’s muse through the portrayal of autumn trees as the leaves of the oak tree changing color. While there is the inclusion of animals and man, the main subject would surround the moment of movement for nature as the September leaves change transitioning to their warmer selves. The details of the natural environment would not be so much of the physicality of the oak trees, but rather their temperament. The personal expression shown in this piece through reverence of beauty and awe of nature’s response to the season would allude to Rousseau’s relationship with nature."

        data-text="Claude Monet’s oil on canvas, “La Pie,” (1868-1869) was created during the period that Monet began to experiment with capturing sensations and rapidly transitioning states of nature. The painting presents a winter landscape full of snow that is presented from the ground to the roofs of the houses as well as blending in with the sky. The mix of wood and snow with the artificial wooden creations by man as well as the homes combine the natural with artifice in a cohesive blend. In this scene, there is a single magpie perched on the wooden gate. The piece is vibrant yet concordant with the given color palette as Monet uses a distinctive range of blues, purples, and yellows to create the illusion of snow within sunlight. In this piece, there is the capacity to present cool tones in a warm aspect. This is mostly due to the use of light to be presented that Monet’s brushstroke allowed. The expressive brushstrokes facilitate and emphasize the fleeting effects of the light on the snow, providing a quick glimpse towards the near future of its melt. The sunlight is also shown through the shadows that are cast through the gate and the magpie. Although the magpie is off-center, he is the main subject outside of snow that the eye is drawn towards. The trees that continue in the distance create a sense of depth as well as the snow that is distinct and staggered. This piece invokes a sense of nostalgia and the viewers can imagine this piece as more of a memory than the present."

        data-text="Camille Pisarro’s oil on canvas, “Chestnut Trees at Louveciennes,” (1872), captures Pissaro’s mission to present the nature of rural landscapes through the Impressionistic portrayal. The warmth of the painting could be misleading to the season of the year it is depicting. The indication of it being a winter landscape would be the lack of life being shown on the branches of the leaves. It would be the transition between autumn and winter. The earthy color palette along with the vibrant yellows, greens, browns, and blues seem to belong more toward a summer color palette. Pissarro’s brushwork flows along with the foliage and textures of the chestnut tree trunks as well as the shows they cast. It is the shadows and contrasts with light that create an effect of movement that is facilitated through the brushwork. They then create splotches of light along the grass as parts of filled with yellow and green hues. The landscape evokes a chilling sensation as the viewer moves their gaze from right to left, from the warmth to the cooler shadows. The gradation of color both in the landscape and the sky, presents the transition from autumn to winter is shown through the warmer hues on the right but the inevitable return of winter starts to grow on the left. The plein air painting is shown through the rapidity of what is being presented in this scene of Louveciennes so that viewers can have a direct experience of the season’s transition."

        data-text="Alfred Sisley’s oil on canvas, “La Neige à Louveciennes (Snow at Louveciennes),” (1878) now shows the fullness of winter of Louveciennes in this landscape piece. The canvas shows a snowy row that is bordered on each side. There is a mixture of man-made buildings and tools as well as trees and bushes all covered in snow. Sisley’s brushwork is shown expressively as well and it is quick and distinct. The lone person in the middle of this composition depicts the loneliness and quietness of this scene. However, mixed with the warm tones, it seems more like a peaceful solitude of a walk rather than a negative loneliness. The quietude of this winter scene is also presented through the light that flickers through the snow. It is a snowy landscape full of haze, light, and warmth. There is a diversity and altering pattern between the snow and the light that creates an atmosphere of softness and depth. The piece has a lack of harsh outlines that give it a whimsical and airy emotion that the snowfall brings. Sisley provides the viewer, through the nuanced brushstrokes, a connection of human life and emotion with nature’s soft snow."

        data-text="Claude Monet’s oil on canvas, “Snow at Argenteuil,” (1874-75) depicts a snowy winter landscape in the town of Argenteuil. Alongside buildings and people in the distance, there are two central figures on the road. Monet uses a more muted color palette in this piece mostly filled with blues and whites. We see a common pattern in Monet’s winter landscapes being filled with cooler tones but also containing flickers of warm colors. The composition is balanced overall with a blanket of snow being layered on each surface, over the houses and trees. The use of light, like in most of Monet’s winter landscapes is a central focus. It’s more subtle in this piece, however, it is still quite evident through the shadows on the snow and the gradience of the sky going from a warmer white to cooler blue in the distance to the foreground. The composition is also harmonized as the light and shadow parallel each other with the sky and snow on the ground. Although there are more people included in this piece, the most out of the landscapes being presented on this website, there is still a strong sense of tranquility being evoked towards the viewer."

        src="pictures/stack_wheat_snow_sunset.jpg"
        data-text="Claude Monet’s oil on canvas, “Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect),” (1891) depicts rural life in the winter. The scene presents a vibrant and color-filled landscape with brushstrokes that move in a cohesive direction in various segments of the piece. From the bottom left corner, the brushstrokes, rapid and strong, move diagonally from top left to bottom right. Other areas such as the ski seem to move from bottom left to top right. The same brushstrokes that are short and quick are also seen in the haystacks. There is no strong outline but the distinctness of the haystacks amid the other strokes is shown through the contrast between light and shadow. There is a strong use of color which contrasts from the traditional white snow blankets that are more commonly shown in winter landscape pieces. The use of color is shown through the blues, reds, and purples in the foreground and haystacks as well as the warm tones of orange and red in the setting sun. The use of red is shown both in the cool tones as well as the warm. This depiction of light being shown at a colorful time of day shows the energetic relationship between the winter landscape and the setting sun."

        src="pictures/effect_petit-montrouge.jpeg"
        data-text="Édouard Manet’s oil on canvas, “Effect of Snow at Petit-Montrouge,” (1870) depicts a muted, brown, grey, and white winter landscape. The primary color contrast in this piece is interesting as it is mostly between the landscape and the snow. Manet presents this view of the church of Saint-Pierre at Petit-Montrouge. It provides a clear and balanced composition as the grey sky is separated from the grey homes just by the subtle variations in hues. The brown hues are then used for more of the natural landscape. The blanket of snow as well as what is shown as the fog in the background are the brighter whites. The white snow is the main indicator and representation of light shown in this piece. The brushstroke is expressive while direct and linear which plays a dominant role in showing the atmosphere of the piece. Manet’s use of color, composition, and brushwork interplays with each other to add complexity and depth to this piece."
